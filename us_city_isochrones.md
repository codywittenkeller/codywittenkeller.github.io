## US City Isochrones using Google Maps Geocode API and CARTO Isoline API

**Project description:** This short project takes a list of the top 20 cities in the United States by Population, programatically pulls geo information for each city using Google Maps API, then creates a 60 minutes "isochrone" for each city using CARTO Isoline API. The isochrone shapes are then ranked by area to show which cities have the largest transportation coverage within a single hour. Results showed that cities in Texas had the largest driving distance within an hour, and coastal cities and higher trafficked cities had the smallest of the top 20.
